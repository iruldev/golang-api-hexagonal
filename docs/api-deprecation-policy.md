# API Deprecation Policy

> **Note**: This is a placeholder document. The full deprecation policy will be implemented in Story 4.7.

## Overview

This document outlines the policy for deprecating API versions and endpoints.

### Key Principles

1.  **Notice Period**: We provide a minimum of 6 months notice before removing any stable endpoint.
2.  **Communication**: Deprecations are communicated via HTTP headers, email, and documentation.
3.  **Support**: We determine a reasonable overlap period where both old and new versions are supported.

For detailed versioning strategy, please refer to [API Versioning Strategy](./api-versioning.md).
