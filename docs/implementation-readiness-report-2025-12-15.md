## Architecture Alignment

### Core Decisions ✅

| Decision | Impact | Stories |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Hybrid Error Registry | Epic 2 | Story 2.2 |
| Policy Pack Directory | Epic 1 | Story 1.1, 1.2 |
| Context Propagation (Both) | Epic 2 | Story 2.3 |
| Spec-First OpenAPI | Epic 5 | Story 5.1 |
| Hybrid Test Organization | All | Test Design |

### Layer Boundaries ✅

- depguard enforcement configured in Story 1.2
- Hexagonal architecture maintained
- No cross-layer violations in stories

---

## Test Design Alignment ✅

| Dimension | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Controllability | PASS |
| Observability | PASS |
| Reliability | PASS |
| Test Levels | 70% unit, 25% integration, 5% E2E |

## Adversarial Review Findings

### Issues Found

| Issue | Severity | Status | Resolution |
|-------|----------|--------|------------|
| Two architecture files | Info | Resolved | Both serve different purposes |
| CI performance ASR-3 | High Priority | Planned | Story 1.5 addresses this |
| No test fixtures yet | Medium | Planned | Add to Story 1.5 or Epic 1 |

### Critical Gaps

**None identified.**

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Score | Mitigation | Epic/Story |
|------|-------|------------|------------|
| CI p50 ≤8min | 6 | Parallel jobs, caching | 1.5 |
| Context propagation | 4 | Linter + wrapper | 2.3, 2.4 |
| Coverage ≥80% | 4 | CI gate | 1.5 |

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Before Sprint 1)

1. Run `/bmad-bmm-workflows-sprint-planning` to create sprint status
2. Start with Epic 1: Foundation & Quality Gates

### Sprint 1 Priorities

1. Story 1.1: Setup Policy Pack Directory
2. Story 1.2: Configure depguard Layer Boundaries
3. Story 1.3: Implement Makefile Developer Commands
4. Story 1.4: Add Pre-commit Hook Support
5. Story 1.5: Setup CI Pipeline with Quality Gates
6. Story 1.6: Implement Fail-Fast Config Validation
