# User Context (from guided setup)
user_description: |
  Upgrade dan standarkan proyek golang-api-hexagonal (legacy codebase) menjadi 
  "international production-grade backend boilerplate" berbasis hexagonal architecture.
  
  Scope:
  1. Audit & perbaiki bug/anti-pattern (correctness, concurrency, config, authz, validation)
  2. Security hardening: authN/authZ, proxy/IP trust, PII redaction, endpoint protection
  3. Observability e2e: correlation, metrics/tracing, health checks
  4. DI dengan Google Wire + lifecycle management
  5. Secret management: env + file mount + Vault/Cloud SM readiness
  6. Data layer: sqlc adoption, typed SQL, integration tests
  7. Lengkapi artifact BMM untuk AI-guided development
  
  Outcome: Repo siap dipakai tim lain untuk service baru dengan standar internasional.
