# Retrospective: Epic 1 - Correctness & Bug Fixes

**Date:** 2025-12-24
**Participants:** Alice (PO), Bob (SM), Charlie (Dev), Dana (QA), Elena (Dev), Gan (Project Lead)

## 📊 Agile Metrics
- **Completed Stories:** 5/5 (100%)
- **Status:** Complete (Correctness items fixed)
- **Deployment:** Staging Verified, Ready for Production

## 🏆 Successes (What Went Well)
1. **Adversarial Code Review:** Caught critical bugs (e.g., hardcoded config in Story 1.1) before merging. The strict process is painful but effective.
2. **UUID Handling:** Story 1.4 established a strong pattern for field-level validation errors, setting a high standard for API contracts.
3. **Idempotency:** Story 1.5 ensured solid database migration safety, preventing deployment race conditions.

## ⚠️ Challenges (Growth Areas)
1. **Over-Engineering:** In Story 1.2, the team initially tried to manually manage pool reconnection, missing that `pgxpool` handles it natively. Lesson: *Trust your tools and verify assumptions before coding.*
2. **Test Brittleness:** Initial integration tests for migrations (Story 1.5) were flaky. We need to prioritize stable test environments.

## 🚀 Next Epic: Security Baseline (Epic 2)
**Focus:** Authentication, JWT robustness, and Production Guards.
**Risk Level:** High (Security Critical).

### 📝 Action Items
1. **Verify Test Infrastructure:** Ensure we can safely test "Production Mode" guards (Story 2.3) in CI without breaking dev workflows. (Owner: Dana/DevOps)
2. **Auth Architecture Review:** Perform a technical spike on JWT handling before starting implementation stories to prevent architectural rework. (Owner: Charlie/Arch)

### 🚦 Decision Log
- **Recommendation:** Proceed with a **Technical Spike & Prep Phase** for Epic 2 rather than jumping straight into stories.
- **Reasoning:** High security risk requires validated architecture first.
